# Super Mario Odyssey - Visible Hit-Sensors

Please note that the custom models do not work on console yet! 

This mod allows you to see Mario and Cappy's `HitSensors`, or hit boxes, during gameplay, as well as their positions, marked with a purple coin. 
In order for this to show anything, you'll have to edit your own stage to add in `Coin` objects with the following names (in UnitConfig -> DisplayName):

`pos`
`head`
`body`
`foot`
`capPos`
`Trample`
`SpiralTail1`
`SpiralTail2`
`SpiralTail3`
`SpiralTail4`
`SpiralTail5`

Both `pos` and `capPos` should have a model name of `CoinPink`, while everything else should have a model name of `HitSensor`. An example of these objects is in the included `romfs` folder, in `CapWorldHomeStageMap.szs`, Scenario 3 (post-moon rock).

You can toggle the visibility of Mario and Cappy by holding ZL and pressing ZR. 

A known issue currently is that if one of the objects goes too far offscreen, it will unload. A fix is currently being worked on.

## Prerequisites

- [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) 
- Python 3
- The [Keystone-Engine](https://www.keystone-engine.org/) Python Module

## Building

Build has only been tested on WSL2 running Ubuntu 20.04.1.

Just run:
```
DEVKITPRO={path_to_devkitpro} make
```

On Ubuntu (and other Debian-based systems), devkitPro will be installed to `/opt/devkitpro` by default:

```
DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro/ make
```

## Installing (Atmosph√®re)

After a successful build, simply transfer the `atmosphere` folder located inside `starlight_patch_100` to the root of your switch's SD card.
